# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
This project was done using Python in a Jupyter notebook. The goal was to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to help the company understand 
if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
Three methods were used, probability, hypothesis testing and regression.
